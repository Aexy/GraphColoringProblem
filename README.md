# Graph Coloring Problem
The problem in hand requires every vertex of a graph to be colored while none of the neighbouring vertices have the same color.
The main goal of this project is to better understand how the problem is solved using backtracking and to explore alternative solution methods to really grasp why it is so difficult to come up with an optimized solution algorithm.
You can create your own graph using provided methods and see if backtracking is able to solve your graph for a given number of colors.

## Improvements
I have left myself, (and the people who might be interested in contributing to this problem), a set of ideas I had, which can be tried out. Who knows, maybe an optimization process can be found after all.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my Computability project group for encouraging me and supporting this project. Through our brainstorming sessions and discussions, I was able to look at the problem from different perspectives.
